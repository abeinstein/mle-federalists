HW5 README
Andrew Beinstein

hw5.py: Python script containing the main code
document.py: Contains the Document class I used to represent a single Federalist Paper
extra_credit.py: Contains the code I used for the extra credit. WARNING: Uses the NLTK Python
library. I'm not sure if the Linux machines have that installed. 
hw5.pdf: The write-up containing explanations/descriptions/plots/etc
federalist: Directory containing the federalist papers

To reproduce the results found in the write-up, refer to hw5.py. At the bottom of the file,
I have indicated some lines of code that you can uncomment in order to reproduce the results
I printed in the write-up. Reproducing the extra-credit involves installing the NLTK library, 
feel free to ask me for assistance if that does not work! 

Cheers,
Andrew
